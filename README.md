# De Verbeelde Stad 

This Adamlink sample app:

- gives access to depictions of Amsterdam in pain, print or pencil from the collections of several Amsterdam GLAM institutions
- SPARQLs within a boundingbox
- shows the benefits of the Art & Architecture Thesaurus when querying over multiple collections

Being a lab application, it's rather quick & dirty. It's a php / js application, should run on any php server.
